# Discovering the impacts of the global energy transition on Food-Energy-Water sectors through diverse cross-ensemble aggregation measures (Kim et al. 2024, in review)

This repository contains the code used to generate the figures in the paper Discovering the impacts of the global energy transition on Food-Energy-Water sectors through diverse cross-ensemble aggregation measures by Kim et al. (2024) currently under revision at Earth's Future.

## Contents
This repository is supplement to Kim et al. (2024): https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11104871

To generate the GCAM-LAC databases used in this analysis, follow the instructions from Wessel et al. (2024) found here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10895134. 
Following these instructions will produce the GCAM databases for each scenario included in the analysis.

To replicate the results from this analysis, generate the raw query results using the scripts found in the query_scripts directory (see query_request1.R for an example of how to run a query) and then run the R scripts and Jupyter notebooks found in main_figures and supplemental_figures directories.

## Steps to reproduce the results from the paper
